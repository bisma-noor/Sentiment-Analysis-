# Sentiment-Analysis-
This project on Sentiment Analysis used 1200 UrbanClap reviews with ML and DL models. After preprocessing and using BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec, models like SVM, LSTM, and Decision Tree were tested. TF-IDF + Decision Tree gave 98% accuracy. A research paper was also created from this work.
